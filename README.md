# DailyKind-APP

This app was programmed as part of a university project and was created in a group of four. The app is about doing good things and being rewarded with gamification elements. It's a non-profit app that offers daily tasks to improve the world. The tasks are retrieved from Chatgpt via an API call and then imported into the app - which will change daily. Other elements such as chatting, adding friends, leaderboards, a daily calendar, a profile screen etc., have also been implemented. Users are also stored in a database so they can log in and track the status of their tasks. The app also allows you to collect badges and compare it with your friends.

The App was build with React Native and is optimized for Google Pixel 5 and Google Pixel 6. It provides a User friendly design which is based on a Human-Computer-Interaction Pattern. It provides Back-End as well as Front-End.

NOTE: Not all the Pictures for the APP have been uploaded due to time reasons.
